    <h1>Laputa's Stew (from Castle in the Sky)</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      We can't forget the delicious looking stew that Sheeta cooks up for her
      sailor crew in this Ghibli classic, Castle in the Sky. Sheeta makes a warm and
      hearty winter vegetable stew that combines earthy and sweet flavors -
      perfect for fueling an upcoming adventure to an unknown land! Even though
      she uses no meat, the vegetables that absorb the dashi stock give this
      dish a very savory flavor; however, feel free to add meat or any other
      vegetables that you like!

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Mix your dashi broth and water. In a separate bowl, mix all the soup flavorings
    together. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Cut all your veggies (carrots, potataoes, onions) into bite sized pieces.
    Finely chop the scallions.</li>
  <li>Cut off the stems of the shiitake mushrooms and cut all the heads
    in half diagonally.
  </li>
  <li>Heat up a pot and add the olive oil. Then add the onions and stir for about
    2 to 3 minutes until the edges become translucent.
  </li>
  <li>Add the carrots and potatoes. Continute to stir for about 1 to 2 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>Add in the mushrooms then continue to stir for another 1 to 2 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>Add the broth into the pan. The broth level should come above the vegetables,
    if not simply add more water or dashi stock until it does.
  </li>
  <li>Bring the water to a boil. Leave it boiling for a minute or two before bringing it
    back to a simmer. Add in the flavoring after bringing it to a simmer.
  </li>
  <li>
    After about 20 minutes of simmering, you're delicious, adventure-fueling soup should be ready!
