<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  Spirited Away was filled with a variety of ridiculously tantalizing foods, but
  we'll start with one of the most simple: onigiri! This comforting dish (and
  lovely symbol of friendship in the movie) is a staple snack in Japan that is
  pretty easy to recreate at home.

  <li>Wrap a mound of rice in your hands and add some of salmon
    mayo mixture to the center. Cover the mixture with rice and
    form the mound into a ball.
  </li>
  <li>Shape the mound of rice into a triangle using your hands or
    a triangle cookie cutter.

    set for 5-10 minutes.

  <li>Once ready to serve, press a nori strip around the bottom of
    each onigiri. The rice should be sticky enough that the nori sticks.
  </li>

    creation!
