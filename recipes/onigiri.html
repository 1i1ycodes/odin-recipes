<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Spirited Away was filled with a variety of ridiculously tantalizing foods, but
  we'll start with one of the most simple: onigiri! This comforting dish (and
  lovely symbol of friendship in the movie) is a staple snack in Japan that is
  pretty easy to recreate at home.

<ul>
  <li>6 mini sheets of roasted seaweed</li>
  <li>3/4 shredded cooked salmon</li>
  <li>1 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
  <li>6 cups cooked sticky rice</li>
  <li>a triangle shaped cookie cutter</li>
</ul>
